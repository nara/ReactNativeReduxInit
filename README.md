##react-native-app-boilerplate
> React Native / Redux boilerplate.

Copied the structure and code from [formidable boilerplate](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/formidable-react-native-app-boilerplate) without babel since react native has babel preset included.

#### Set up

- Make sure XCode is installed.

- git clone this repo or just download zip 

- You can either copy this structure mainly src folder, index.ios.js and index.android.js files to your new folder
created by `react-native init` or you can rename this folder and app names to match your app.

- Open XCode and open `/ios/ReactNativeReduxInit.xcodeproj`

#### Running IOS

Simply run the project in XCode

#### Running Android

From your command line run `react-native run-android` - I havent tested this.
